This project isn't done yet. It's a work in progress. will continue updating. Please let me know a specific feature you'll want me to add or if you find any issue with the code.


## First

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that the script depend on, and you should install it using:

""" pip install -r requirements.txt """

You have to register an account with vonage to get access to their SMS API. So head over to https://dashboard.nexmo.com/ to register and account and collect your KEY and SECRET for client authentication.
Secondly, head over to https://api.coinmarketcap.com to get your free API key for crypto data inquiry.

## Third

An Email plus password is required by the library `yagmail` to send yourself Email. You can create a new gmail just for that purpose or use your own. And for it to work, you have to turn on Less secure app on https://accounts.google.com for that account that you'll use to send yourself email.

## Fourth

You have to create a bot on telegram using @BotFather or use one if you already have it. That bot will be used to send yourself message on telegram.

## Lastly

You should put all your credentials (APIs, Secret keys, email and pass) into `.env` file and access them using enviromental variable so that nobody can have access to your credentials.
